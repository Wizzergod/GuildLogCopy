# wow-3.3.5-addons-GuildLogExtract
This is a simple addon to extract and copy guild logs in WoW 3.3.5, text, CSV and JSON formats,  because by default the game does not allow editing or copying logs,  but with this addon it is possible, wait to load the game guild log then type /glog to open addon window.
